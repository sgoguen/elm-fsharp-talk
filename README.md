# Elm & F# Talk

## Part 1 - Getting Started (15 minutes)

1. Getting up and running with Elm
  * [`elm init`](https://elm-lang.org/0.19.0/init)
  * `elm reactor`
  > The idea is that Elm projects should be so simple that nobody needs a tool to generate a bunch of stuff. This also captures the fact that project structure should evolve organically as your application develops, never ending up exactly the same as other projects. - Evan Czaplicki (creator of Elm)

2. Getting up and running with F#
  1. Getting Started with F# Fable - https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/minimal
  2. Walkthrough of NPM, webpack and dotnet core toolset
  3. Counter example
  
## Part 2 - TodoMVC (15-20 minutes)

1. Defining the model in Elm and F# - Side-by-side
2. Update Methods
   * Core methods
   * Explaining Commands
3. View Methods

## Part 3 - Differences (15 - 20 minutes)

* Where Elm Shines
  * Simple tooling that gets you up and running quickly
  * Heavy emphasis on reducing runtime errors
  * Exceptionally fast
  * Curated libraries
  * Ports
* Where Elm has yet to shine
  * No backend programming support
* Where F# Shines
  * Same F# code can be used on both front-end and backend
  * Powerful, yet controlled language and meta-language features
    * Type providers
    * Active Patterns
    * Quotations (Allowing F# to be translated to JavaScript)
* Where F# can improve
  * Often too much choice in tooling
  * Many excellent tools, but others could be friendlier to newbs
  * Experience isn't as cultivated
